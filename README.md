# DisplaySwitcher
A simple Python script to change between HDMI and Hyperpixel displays at startup.

# WARNING! Changing system files can be dangerous and damge your systems function. 
Always make a backup of config files before use. A default version of the config file can be found at:  https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen/blob/dev/stage1/00-boot-files/files/config.txt 

In order to run, add the two config.txt files to your /boot/ directory and run the Display Switcher Python script anywhere you'd like.

Beware: changing the config file of your Pi can alter raspi-config settings.
You will have to alter these settings on both the HDMI and Hyperpixel config files.
